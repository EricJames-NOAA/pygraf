# ADB Graphics Creation for UPP Model Output

This repository houses a Python-based implementation of the graphics package
that is responsible for generating maps for the RAP/HRRR/FV3 data. It is
eventually meant to replace the NCL Graphics suite currently populating the
real-time pages (https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/).

# Overview

The ADB_Grapics Python package contains all the necessary modules for generating
the graphics.

# Python environment

The Python environment required to generate the graphics is defined by the
environment.yml file. This requires access to an implementation of conda. To
install this environment named ADBGraphics, do the following:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ADBGraphics
```

# Run the package

TBD
